## The Reality

- Grandparent fraud costs seniors $3B+ annually
- Existing apps treat seniors like children
- Families feel helpless watching their parents become targets
- Current solutions focus on fear, not empowerment

## Personal Connection

"After seeing countless news stories about seniors losing their life savings to scams, I realized existing 'solutions' were making the problem worse - they either scared seniors into isolation or were too complex to use."

- Color psychology: Purple (trust) + blue (calm)

**Accessibility Considerations:**

- Large text (18-22px)
- High contrast
- Simple 3-tab navigation
- Touch targets 44px+
- Voice input options

**Show your Figma work:**

- Component library screenshot
- Atomic design structure
- Design tokens/system

### **7. Technical Challenges & Solutions** ⭐

```
Challenge: Built on a 2014 Mac Mini with 8GB RAM
Solution: Strategic tech choices, efficient workflow

Challenge: Refactored entire codebase (Tamagui → NativeWind)
Solution: 2-day migration to ensure long-term maintainability

Why this matters: Shows resourcefulness and commitment
```
